WHO WE ARE?
CICLO closet is a business with two main focuses: a second-hand store and a blog with informative content regarding fashion, sustainability and circular economy.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The second-hand store is an open marketplace where any woman can sell their own clothes and also find pre-loved pieces for themselves. Every sale gives you coins that can be spent on the website or redeemed into real money. Our goal is to increase women's self-esteem at the same time that creates the opportunity to increase their income.

THE WORLD NEEDS INFORMATION
The Fashion Industry is responsible for 10% of the world's pollution, so it's our obligation to help create a better environment and dissipate information as much as we can. Our informative blog brings to attention new sustainable markets, creations and business ideas for a better world to come.

We believe in a fashion industry based on three principles: clean, fair and good.

## My plan / approach
It's a webpage where the user will be able to sign up, login, logout and buy items in the second-hand marketplace and also read content in the blog.

Pages: Home, About, Shop and Blog
User pages: Sign up, Login and Logout.
3 tables: users, shop and blog.

## Cool tech that I used
